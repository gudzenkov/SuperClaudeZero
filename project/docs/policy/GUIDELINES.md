# General Guidelines

Common guidance: code style, framework conventions, testing practices, deployment procedures.

*Add project-specific guidelines here. Examples:*
- *Code style: "Use functional components with hooks, no class components"*
- *Framework: "All API routes must use the BaseController pattern"*
- *Testing: "Integration tests required for all database operations"*
- *Dependencies: "Prefer native fetch over axios"*
